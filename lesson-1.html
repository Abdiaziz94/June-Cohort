    <main> This is is the recipe for our famous chocolate brownies,<br>
        we have kept this as a secret for far too long and have finally decided to share this with the world.

       <div> 
        <h2>Ingredeints</h2>
       <LI> 3 Sticks (340 g) salted butter</LI>
       <li> 1 pound of bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
       <li> Half a cup of grantulated sugar</li>
       <li> 1 cup of light brown sugar</li>
       <li> 5 Large eggs</li>
       <li> 1 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla extract</li>
       <li> 1 1/3 cups of all purpose flour</li>
       <li> Half a tablespoon of baking powder</li>
       <li> Half a teaspoon of salted</li>
       <li> 1 to 2 cups (170 to 320 g) semisweet chocolate chips</li> 
      </div>
       
       <div>
       <h2>Instructions</h2>
       <ol><li>Prereheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a large rimmed baking sheet.</li>
       <li>In a large microwave-safe bowl, combine the butter and chocolate.<br>Microwave in 1-minute intervals, stirring in between, until the mixture is melted and smooth
       <br>(don't overheart, it should be slightly warm).
        Add the sugar and stir until combined.</li> 
        <li>Whisk in the eggs and vanilla, and mix until large bubbles pop at the surface. <br>It will go from
            looking slightly curled to really glossy and thick so keep stirring until you see the change.
        <br>In a separate smaller bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
        <br>Add the dry ingredients to the batter and mix once or twice. <br> With dry streaks remaining, add the chocolatechip chips
            and mix until well-combined.
         <li>Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.</li>
         <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes until edges are set but the middle is still slightly gooey. <br> 
             If you want extra dense, fudgy brownies,  halfway through the baking time, <br>carefully lift up the baking pan
             and let it drop on the oven rack to reselase any air bubbles (this is optional). <br>
             let the brownies cool completely in the pan, and afer that you are all done. </ol>
